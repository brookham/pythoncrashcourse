# your goal:
# add code to the function below.
# The code has a parameter called num
# The goal of the function is to return a list with every EVEN number from 0 until one less than num.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
def even_numbers(num):
   list_num = list(range(10))
    # num is a positive integer greater than zero
    # return a list of all even integers from 0 until 1 less than the number
    # For example, if the number is 6, return [0,2,4]
for num in list_num:
   
    if 
    # write your code here    

    # replace the return value your even number list
    return []
